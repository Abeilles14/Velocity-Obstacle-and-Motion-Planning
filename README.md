This thesis focuses on the development of an integrated task and motion planning (TMP) strategy for a multilateral automated model, which provides a flexible task coordination approach in a dynamic environment. Motion Planning will be implemented to generate a collision-free path for each PSM moving towards an individual point of interest. The position and range of each individual arm will also be tracked in order to avoid possible collisions. The objectives of this work concern identifying and handling collisions with the static environment obstacles and potential collisions with PSMs dynamically without impeding the parallelism aspect of the robotic arm movements.
